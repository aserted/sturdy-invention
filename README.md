# First program
First time creating a simple calculator
<br>
using function, try/except, match etc
<br>
explanantion:
<br>
This part defines the function to do addition, subtraction, average, multiplication and division <br>
the functions have the parameter numbers
<br>
There is a list which stores the numbers given by the user in the list number_list <br>
The next part is to take the user input (ask them what operation they want to perform or they can exit the program if they want to bgy entering an alphabet)
<br>
if the user enters what they want to do the the program asks them to enter the numbers on which they want to perform the operations on <br>
then after getting the input from user the numbers are appended in number_list as an argument which is passed through the function parameters <br>
Afetr the user has enterd all the numbers they wanted to now the program uses match case to match the operation the user wants to perform and gives the output
